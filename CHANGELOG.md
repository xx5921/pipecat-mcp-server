# Changelog

All notable changes to **Pipecat MCP Server** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.0.12] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where multiprocessing queues were not properly closed during
  cleanup, which could cause resource leaks.
  
- Increased process join timeout from 1s to 5s for more reliable shutdown.

## [0.0.11] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- New `capture_screenshot()` MCP tool that captures the current screen frame and
  returns an image path. This allows the agent to visually analyze what's on
  screen and help with debugging, UI feedback, and more.

## [0.0.10] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- New `list_windows()` MCP tool to list all open windows with title, app name,
  and window ID.

- New `screen_capture(window_id)` MCP tool to start or switch screen capture to
  a specific window or full screen during a voice conversation.

### Changed

- Screen capture dependencies are now included by default (no longer an optional
  `[screen]` extra).

- Screen capture is no longer configured via environment variables
  (`PIPECAT_MCP_SERVER_SCREEN_CAPTURE`, `PIPECAT_MCP_SERVER_SCREEN_WINDOW`).
  Use the `list_windows()` and `screen_capture()` tools instead.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- Linux X11 screen capture backend using python-xlib.

- Native macOS screen capture using ScreenCaptureKit. Supports true window-level
  capture not affected by overlapping windows.

## [0.0.8] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- Updated to Pipecat >= 0.0.101.

## [0.0.7] - 2026-01-31

### Changed

- `KokoroTTSService` now uses `kokoro-onnx`.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- Added `KokoroTTSService` processor.

- Added noise cancellation with `RNNoiseFilter`.

- Simplified the `/pipecat` skill instructions.

### Changed

- Replaced third-party STT/TTS services (Deepgram, Cartesia) with local models:
  Faster Whisper for speech-to-text and Kokoro for text-to-speech. No API keys
  required.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that would cause an MCP session to crash and would force the
  MCP client to reconnect each time.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where Daily clients couldn't reconnect after disconnecting.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fixed premature exit of the `/pipecat` skill when user responds with phrases
  like "no", "nothing", or "that's it" instead of explicit ending phrases.

- Fixed an issue where WebRTC clients couldn't reconnect after disconnecting.
  The agent now properly handles disconnect/reconnect cycles.

- Fixed an issue where `pipecat-mcp-server` could hang indefinitely after
  pressing Ctrl-C.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-01-26

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that would cause the Pipecat agent to not load if the optional
  `daily` dependency was not installed.
